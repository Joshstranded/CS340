Journal Reflection
1. Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs

I write programs with modularity, clear documentation, and reusable components in mind. For this course, I developed a CRUD Python module in Project One, which allowed me to separate database 
logic from the dashboard’s user interface in Project Two. This made the code more readable and maintainable because each part of the project had a single responsibility. The advantage of 
working this way was that I could reuse the CRUD module across different dashboards or projects without rewriting the core database logic. In the future, this same CRUD module could be adapted 
to work with other applications that need MongoDB access, such as analytics dashboards or data collection systems.

2. Approaching problems as a computer scientist

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into smaller, solvable tasks. For Grazioso Salvare, I first reviewed the database requirements and then mapped those to the 
dashboard features. Compared to earlier courses, this project required me to think more like a developer working for a client: I had to focus on user needs and how the database and dashboard 
could directly support them. I used strategies like abstraction (with the CRUD module), incremental testing, and visualization tools to meet the client’s request. In future database projects, I 
would continue to use modular design and iterative testing to ensure scalability and accuracy.

3. What computer scientists do and why it matters

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by applying computational thinking, creating efficient systems, and making data useful. In this project, my work would help Grazioso Salvare by
giving them a dashboard that makes it easy to identify and track dogs for rescue training. By automating searches and presenting data in a clear visual format, the organization could save time, 
reduce manual errors, and make better decisions. This reflects the broader role of computer scientists: enabling organizations to work smarter and achieve their missions more effectively.
